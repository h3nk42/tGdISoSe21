	abstract = {Throughout much of modern project management's sixty-year history, researchers have primarily studied the tools and techniques aiding performance and ignored the factors influencing behavior. But in the 21st century, more researchers are now expanding the field's vision beyond the hard elements of project management to include the soft aspects of managing projects. This paper examines the initial results of a five-stage research study on the relationships between a project manager's leadership style and project success and a project manager's leadership style and different project types. In doing so, it reviews both the general management and project management literature relating to leadership style and organizational and project performance, explaining the seven schools of thought on leadership and using this information to formulate two research hypotheses and a research model as well as it variables. It then discusses interviews with fourteen project managers--from three continents and fromseveral industr},

	abstract = {This research investigates the validity of the traits theory of leadership applied to project management and determines how it correlates to core project management competencies. Previous published work on traits theory of leadership primarily deals with organizational leadership, and not specifically with project leadership. Consequentially, although the previous work is useful in providing a good basis for this paper, additional research is required for application in the field of project management. The necessary data was gathered via researching modern literature on project leadership and through questionnaires sent to project managers with varying levels of project management experience. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the individual's assessment of what core competencies a project manager should possess. In addition to the questionnaire, an online personality assessment was used to determine the participants' Meyers-Briggs (MBTI) personality type. The results of the literature research and the returned questionnaires clearly indicate that certain MBTI types have preferences that support project leadership, specifically, ISTJ, INFJ, INTJ, ENTP, ESTJ, ENFJ, and ENTJ, with INTJ, ESTJ, and ENTJ being the types containing the most traits that supported project leadership competencies.},

	abstract = {In the past, a generation covered a larger span of time, having more members. However, today, thanks to the developments in technology and many other factors generations change frequently having less members and covering a few years. What matters now is the workforce itself and how these different generations work together. The current workforce has 3 generations working together while waiting for the fourth one. Soon, it is inevitable that 5 or 6 generations will be working at the same workplace. As a result, it is crucial to understand the type of leadership a generation prefers in business and academic life. The aim of this study was to find out how leadership style choice differs among four generations (Baby Boomers, Generations X, Generation Y, and Generation Z) of academics and prospective academics in Turkey. In the study, 265 participants from different generation rated the leadership attributes that contribute or impede effective leadership. The Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) Project research survey by House et al. (2004) was used to find out the leadership style choice of different generations. The statistical relationships were determined between the generation variable and the 16 primary leadership subscales through MANOVAs and ANOVAs. The results of the tests showed that significant differences exist among the four different generations in 3 of the 16 leadership subscales. These subscales are Charismatic 3: Self-sacrifice, Conflict-inducer, and Face saver.
Key words: Leadership, Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y, Generation Z.},

It becomes important to understand and adopt leadership skills and competences to cope with modern challenges of project which effect on success or failure of project. The function of project managers is rapidly evolving from managing or directing to leading the projects who must possess essential knowledge, skills, and new emerging concept of leadership. The utility of project management will be more exciting, challenging and critical in coming years, while the position of project manager will also be much more diverse.

A sample of 103 athletes (M age=22.06years, SD=4.37) participated and ranged from club/university level to county standard in a variety of team sports. Participants completed the Leadership Scale for Sport – Preference Version (Chelladurai \& Saleh, 1978) to measure preferred leadership, and the MTQ48 (Clough, Earle, \& Sewell, 2002) to measure mental toughness. Mental toughness was predicted to be significantly and positively related to a preference for training and instructive behaviours, and negatively related to a preference for social support. Linear regression analysis and Pearson correlations were used to analyse the data. Consistent with theoretical predictions, mental toughness was found to be significantly related to a preference for training and instructive behaviours (r=0.40, P{\textless}.01). Results of linear regression analysis revealed the MTQ48 subscales of commitment and challenge were significant predictors of preference for training and instructive behaviours. Total mental toughness was not found to be significantly related to preference for social support, democratic behaviours, autocratic behaviours or positive feedback (P{\textgreater}.05). This suggests that coaches working with mentally tough athletes should consider emphasising training and instructive behaviours if they wish to attain congruence between actual and preferred leadership behaviours. Greater research into the influence of personality upon athlete leadership preferences is encouraged.},

The goal of this study was to determine leadership preferences of a Gen Y cohort as a means to enhance workplace relationships in the 21st-century organization. A sequential, mixed-methods study was employed to explore leadership preferences of a Gen Y cohort. Initially, focus-group interviews were used to generate leadership themes. Based on these themes, an instrument was designed, and Gen Y business students from three higher education institutions were surveyed. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the themes. Five leadership themes emerged in the focus groups and were confirmed through CFA.},

The purpose of this research is to enhance leadership and organizational change initiatives in Romania via the identification of age cohort and gender effects with respect to attitudes towards common leadership behaviors. Design/methodology/approach – The research is conducted via a survey through the administration of questionnaires. The sample consists of 324 managers from commercial and service organizations in Romania, a country in which this issue has not previously been investigated. Findings – The findings reveal that there are differences in preferences for leadership behavior based on age cohorts that reached maturity before or after the fall of Ceauşescu during the 1989 revolution. Also, female participants displayed a greater preference for transformational leadership behaviors relative to transactional leadership behaviors. Originality/value – This is the first study to examine the effects of leadership preference based on age cohorts in Romania. The study also is one of the first to empirically examine the effects of age cohorts on leadership after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. As such, these findings offer guidance in the development and implementation of leadership development initiatives and change management interventions for organizations operating in Romania, and present one example of cohort‐based and leadership‐specific attitude change in a country that is transitioning from communism to a free market system.},

We also tested whether dynamism moderates the relationship between leadership behavior and effectiveness. Personality was measured through self ratings using the NEO-PI-R. Subordinates rated their leaders' behavior, and peers and superiors provided ratings of effectiveness. Consistent with trait activation theory, results showed that perceived dynamic work environment moderated the relationships of four of the Big Five-Factors with both charismatic and transactional leadership. Also, charismatic leadership was positively related to perceived effectiveness, but only in dynamic contexts. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper seeks to examine whether cultural context facilitates the emergence of different leadership styles. The key objective of the paper is to consider whether leadership styles are culturally‐linked and/or culturally‐biased. Design/methodology/approach – A multifactor leadership questionnaire was utilised to measure differences in leadership styles and to offer explanations as to why the “one size fits all” view is not appropriate. Analysis of variance and t‐tests were utilised to compare means for more than two managerial groups. Findings – The analysis found significant differences between leadership styles and cultural groups, hence, supporting the argument that culture and leadership interact in different ways in diverse contexts. Transactional leadership was found to be strongly aligned with the ratings of managers from Malaysia, and transformational leadership scales correlated with the Australian respondents' mean ratings. Practical implications – Variations in leadership styles are due to cultural influences because people have different beliefs and assumptions about characteristics that are deemed effective for leadership. Therefore, it is fundamental to know what leadership skills and knowledge are valued most by managers on a global level. This information is critical as it offers insight into developing competencies in different workplaces, especially as organisations expand their geographical boundaries into international markets. Originality/value – The findings of the study provide empirical understanding for culturally‐linked leadership styles. The paper contributes to understanding the importance of workforce diversity and attention to other cultures and, thus, enhances our appreciation of today's “global village”.},

The second study investigated prescriptive stereotypes about the importance of leadership styles for the promotion of women and men to different levels in organizations. Inspirational motivation was perceived as more important for men than women and especially important for promotion to CEO. In contrast, individualized consideration was perceived as more important for women than men and especially important for promotion to senior management. Consistent with these stereotypical beliefs about leadership, women interested in promotion may be well advised to blend individualized consideration and inspirational motivation behaviors.},

Measures of six transformational leader behaviors (Articulating a Vision, Providing an Appropriate Model, Fostering the Acceptance of Group Goals, High Performance Expectations, Individualized Support, and Intellectual Stimulation), one transactional leader behavior (Contingent Reward Behavior), employees' trust in their leader, and satisfaction were obtained from 988 exempt employees of a large petrochemical company. Matching evaluations of five citizenship behaviors of these employees (Altruism, Conscientiousness, Courtesy, Civic Virtue, and Sportsmanship) were obtained from their supervisors. In order to determine whether transformational behaviors augment the impact of transactional behaviors, their effects on followers' trust, satisfaction, and citizenship behaviors were examined in the context of the effect of transactional leader behaviors on these same variables. The results indicate that the effects of the transformational leader behaviors on citizenship behaviors are indirect, rather than direct, in that they are mediated by followers' trust in their leaders. Moreover, these results were found not to be wholly attributable to the effects of common method biases. The implications of these findings for future research on transformational leader behaviors, trust, and organizational citizenship behavior are then discussed.},

The aim was to develop a framework of leadership across hierarchical levels that would be useful for leadership development programmes and interventions. Design/methodology/approach – Managers from 38 companies completed a 360‐degree version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. Multiple responses – self, superior, subordinate and peer ratings – were obtained for 367 managers of whom 15 per cent were female and 85 per cent male, aged between 21 and 62 years (mean=42 years), from 38 organizations in the UK manufacturing sector. Of the 367 subjects, unanimous (cases were used only if all ratings agreed on the hierarchical level of the subject) opinions on hierarchical level were gained for 215 (58 per cent), which includes 30 top‐level managers, 33 directors, 54 senior managers, 43 middle managers and 55 lower managers. Data concerning time span were also obtained for 253 managers. Findings – The findings of the research show a distinct pattern of behaviours across different hierarchical levels of organizations. Transformational leadership is equally effective across hierarchical levels in organizations, whereas transactional leadership is not effective at the uppermost hierarchical levels in organizations but effective at levels lower down. Laissez‐faire leadership is ineffective at all hierarchical levels. Originality/value – A framework of effective leadership behaviours across hierarchical levels in organizations was developed from the findings. This framework can be used as a basis for leadership development in UK manufacturing organizations and potentially wider more general organization contexts.},

Numerous investigators have studied leadership styles in different cultures, occupations, organizational settings.

More recent studies are focusing on a full range of leadership styles such as transformational, transactional and passive/avoidant leadership styles. The current study seeks to determine the leadership style of regular faculty members employed by public as well as private sector higher education institutes and universities. The data were collected by administering Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) to 265 faculty members in all. The results revealed that the faculty members in both public and private sectors were practicing transformational and passive/avoidant leadership styles to the same extent. On the other hand transactional leadership style was being experienced significantly with higher degree by the faculty members in private sector than those in public sector.

Key updates include a consolidation of more traditional topics; new research; a new chapter on leadership and ethics; and real-world profiles that now include leaders from lower-level management and the small business sector with whom students can more easily relate. In addition, this edition features greater emphasis on interpersonal skills, one additional "Leadership Case Problem" per chapter, and new "Internet Skill-Building Exercises."Chapter 6, "Leadership Ethics and Social Responsibility," focuses on moral and ethical leadership in relation to standard business practices. In particular, the chapter highlights ethical decision-making and the importance of social responsibility.In keeping with the text' s increased emphasis on interpersonal skills, the "Scoring and Interpretation"section of each "Leadership Self-Assessment" has been expanded to help students better understand and apply their results. Also, each "Leader in Action" box now ends with questions relating the leader being profiled to specific chapter concepts.},

Transformational leadership scales of the MLQ were found to be reliable and significantly predicted work unit effectiveness across the set of studies examined. Moderator variables suggested by the literature, including level of the leader (high or low), organizational setting (public or private), and operationalization of the criterion measure (subordinate perceptions or organizational measures of effectiveness), were empirically tested and found to have differential impacts on correlations between leader style and effectiveness. The operationalization of the criterion variable emerged as a powerful moderator. Unanticipated findings for type of organization and level of the leader are explored regarding the frequency of transformational leader behavior and relationships with effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to examine how project managers' leadership styles and subordinates' organisational commitment correlates with leadership outcomes and work performance of subordinates on construction projects. It provides significant value for both practitioners and academics. On the practical side, it seeks to inform project managers that they can adapt their leadership behaviours in order to enhance subordinates' organizational commitment, improve work performance, and consequently increase a positive working atmosphere. Academically, the study aims to provide additional insights into the leadership field by contributing to the future development of this study area. Design/methodology/approach – Leadership styles and leadership outcomes were measured using Bass and Avolio's multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ). Porter et al.'s organizational commitment questionnaire (OCQ) was used to measure organizational commitment of subordinates. A total of 156 respondents (project managers, engineers and architects) working in construction projects in Thailand participated in the study. Findings – The transformational leadership style has a positive association with work performance and organizational commitment of subordinates more than the transactional style. Transformational leaders produce higher leadership outcomes as well. Practical implications – By applying the results in practice, project managers can adjust their leadership behaviours to support subordinates in producing high work performance and increasing leadership outcomes, whereas the human resource management function of construction companies can also utilize these results for the leadership development effort in their organization. Originality/value – This paper is the first attempt to understand the influence of transformational, transactional and laissez‐faire leadership factors on leadership outcomes and work performance from subordinates in the construction industry in Thailand.},

We hypothesized that evaluations of leadership—and hence the psychometric properties of leadership instruments—may be affected by the context in which leadership is observed and evaluated. Using largely homogenous business samples consisting of 2279 pooled male and 1089 pooled female raters who evaluated same-gender leaders, we found support for the nine-factor leadership model proposed by Bass and Avolio. The model was configurally and partially metrically invariant—suggesting that the same constructs were validly measured in the male and female groups. Mean differences were found between the male and female samples on four leadership factors (Study 1). Next, using factor-level data of 18 independently gathered samples (N=6525 raters) clustered into prototypically homogenous contexts, we tested the nine-factor model and found it was stable (i.e., fully invariant) within homogenous contexts (Study 2). The contextual factors comprised environmental risk, leader–follower gender, and leader hierarchical level. Implications for use of the MLQ and nine-factor model are discussed.},

This is in direct contrast to the general management literature which views effective leadership as a critical success factor in the management of organizations, and has shown that an appropriate leadership style can lead to better performance. We review the general management literature on leadership and leadership styles and show how this is reflected in the project management literature. We indicate where the literature on leadership competencies and emotional intelligence show that appropriate leadership can deliver higher performance. We then review the literature on project success factors, and discuss how and why it ignores the contribution of the project manager. The project management literature does consider the role of the project manager, and so we review what it does say about his or her leadership style and competence.

Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected (in year 2017) from 248 individuals working in ten large project-based organizations from different sectors, each having multiple units in Pakistan. Respondents comprise functional managers and individuals (who have lead or worked on projects), as well as dedicated project managers. Findings: Goal clarity partially mediates the relationship between transformational leadership style and project success. However, in case of the transactional leadership style, there is no mediation as transactional leadership style is not associated with goal clarity. Furthermore, contingent reward is positively associated to project success, while active management by exception is negatively associated to project success. Originality/value: Research suggests that the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between leadership styles (transactional and transformational) and project success are less clear and need to be further explored.

	abstract = {Leadership is widely considered to be an important aspect of project-based organising and there are several reasons to suggest that transformational leadership is of particular relevance in this context. However, there is a dearth of both theoretical and empirical work on leadership in project-based organisations. The aim of this paper is to report the findings of an empirical study comparing the relationship between transformational leadership style and employee motivation, commitment and stress for employees reporting to either project or line managers. The results show that although project managers are not perceived as less transformational, the relationships between transformational leadership and outcomes tend to be less strong for employees reporting to project managers than for those reporting to line managers. Implications for future research on leadership in the project context are explored.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences between leadership competences of project managers and those of functional managers. Design/methodology/approach – Leadership styles of 414 project managers were assessed using a validated research instrument, the leadership development questionnaire. The results were compared with the leadership profiles of over 1,000 functional managers, assessed with the same instrument. Quantitative analysis techniques were used to identify significant differences in the leadership styles of project managers when compared to functional managers. Correlations between leadership competences and leadership performance and follower commitment of project managers were compared with those of functional managers. Findings – The paper finds that project managers score higher than functional managers on conscientiousness, sensitivity, and critical analysis, but they score lower on communication and development competencies. The correlation between the fit of project managers to their organizational context and their leadership performance and follower commitment was calculated. Research limitations/implications – Comparisons show differences in leadership competences for functional and project managers. Managers in general management roles should be trained to a lesser extent in managerial and intellectual competences than those in project management roles. However, solid training in emotional competences is needed for success in both managerial roles. Originality/value – The differences in leadership competences of project managers and line managers from industry and government are identified.},

	abstract = {Purpose – To investigate the new leadership dimensions questionnaire (LDQ) and a related framework for assessing an individual's leadership style in relation to the context in which the leader works; the three new LDQ sub‐scales designed to measure organisational context, follower commitment and leader performance; and the relationship between personality and leadership.Design/methodology/approach – Research is reported on LDQ data from a large sample of leaders and managers (n 222) from a range of public and private organisations. A style score was calculated and then related to data on respondents' biographical – job function, gender, sector and nationality – and FFM personality data.Findings – Results show a reasonably even allocation across all three leadership styles and that the styles are independent of the four important biographical variables. They also show that the five FFM personality factors do not account for any additional variance on any of the styles at a significant level. Results on the factor structure of the organisational context, follower commitment and leader performance scales show them to be reliable scales.Research limitations/implications – A majority of the sample were from the UK, from the private sector and were male. This study did not incorporate measures of job performance or investigate the style and context link. The self‐assessed, not the 360° version of LDQ was used.Practical implications – Some support is provided for the LDQ's use for leadership assessment and development, and for identifying potential, in both public and private sector organisations, with a standardisation sample of more than 1,000 now available. Results also show that the LDQ can be used without losing significant personality‐related variance.Originality/value – LDQ provides a unique opportunity for managers to relate leadership dimensions to three different leadership styles – engaging, goal‐oriented and involving – and, in turn, to the degree of organisational volatility faced by the leader, thus enabling respondents to identify the most appropriate style. Leader performance and follower commitment sub‐scales should facilitate further research by academics into leadership performance.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {Human resource management (HRM) can be viewed as core processes of the project-oriented company, affecting the way the organization acquires and uses human resources, and how employees experience the employment relationship. Knowledge about HRM is produced by researchers and theorists who, through publishing their work in books and journals, construct knowledge in particular ways and in so doing frame the way HRM debates take shape in the academic and practitioner literatures. In most of the extant literature HRM is framed primarily in terms of large, stable organisations, while other organisational types, such as, those relying on projects as the principle form of work design, are marginalised in discussions about what HRM is and how it should be practiced. The authors argue that due to specific characteristics of the project-oriented company, particularly the temporary nature of the work processes and dynamic nature of the work environment, there exist specific challenges for both organisations and employees for HRM in project-oriented companies, and that these have – been neither widely acknowledged nor adequately conceptualised in the extant mainstream HRM or project management literatures. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of past research on HRM in the context of projects, published in the project management, general management, and HRM literatures. We develop a model of what we see as the critical HRM aspects of project-oriented organizing, based on prior research and use it to structure the review. Finally we summarize what we see as the major shortcomings of research in the field of HRM in the project-oriented company and outline a research agenda to address outstanding areas of research on this topic.},

It is suggested that classical definitions of projects are not wrong, just incomplete. The project as a temporary organization is viewed here as a production function, as an agency for assigning resources to the management of change within the functional organization, and as an agency for managing uncertainty. The role of the project manager is also considered. The project manager is chief executive of the temporary organization, and thus their roles in objective setting and motivating team members are emphasized over their role in planning and executing work. Second, as manager of the agency, they are the agent of the owner (principal) and so a second hierarchy of management and control must be put in place to monitor their performance. These agency costs add to the cost of the project, but may also explain why professional recognition is so important to project managers.},

Details are presented on the development of a new questionnaire, The Leadership Dimensions Questionnaire (LDQ), to measure 15 leadership dimensions/constructs. Two pilot studies of the new LDQ are described on a total sample of 222 managers. Data are presented on two item analyses conducted to refine the pilot form. Acceptable reliability and face, content and construct validity of the final instrument was demonstrated. Construct validity was investigated by correlating LDQ scores with personality and team role data. Three new styles of Leadership, similar to Transformational, Transactional and Participative styles, are proposed and research on these styles is reported. A difference (d2) measure is then used to calculate differences between the manager’s own profile and the mean profile for each style. Difference measures for each style are then related to data on managers’ job function, gender, sector and nationality and on their Personality and Team Role data. Advice on interpreting the styles is also provided. Finally, a discussion of the results of the study and proposals for further work are presented.},

Results revealed that the overall fit of the nine-correlated factor model, on its second test, was statistically significant and that indicated that the Full Leadership Model (nine-correlated leadership model) could be the most appropriately and adequately capturing the factor constructs of transformational-transactional leadership.

However, far less attention has been paid to transactional leadership and non-leadership. The current study examined the theoretical and empirical properties of each MLQ transactional leadership and non-leadership measure. We first looked at the four measures together, then examined the measures separately and subjected them to a number of additional analyses that varied depending on the issues of concern.

	abstract = {This article develops a model of a project as a payoff function that depends on the state of the world and the choice of a sequence of actions. A causal mapping, which may be incompletely known by the project team, represents the impact of possible actions on the states of the world. An underlying probability space represents available information about the state of the world. Interactions among actions and states of the world determine the complexity of the payoff function. Activities are endogenous, in that they are the result of a policy that maximizes the expected project payoff.A key concept is the adequacy of the available information about states of the world and action effects. We express uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity in terms of information adequacy. We identify three fundamental project management strategies: instructionism, learning, and selectionism. We show that classic project management methods emphasize adequate information and instructionism, and demonstrate how modern methods fit into the three fundamental strategies. The appropriate strategy is contingent on the type of uncertainty present and the complexity of the project payoff function. Our model establishes a rigorous language that allows the project manager to judge the adequacy of the available project information at the outset, choose an appropriate combination of strategies, and set a supporting project infrastructure—that is, systems for planning, coordination and incentives, and monitoring.},

Sources of uncertainty are wide ranging and have a fundamental effect on projects and project management. These sources are not confined to potential events, and include lack of information, ambiguity, characteristics of project parties, tradeoffs between trust and control mechanisms, and varying agendas in different stages of the project life cycle. Common project management practice does not address many fundamental sources of uncertainty, particularly in ‘soft’ projects where flexibility and tolerance of vagueness are necessary.

	abstract = {Purpose- Aims to examine effective leader behaviors from direct participant observations in several cases of a large multiyear cross-industry international research project to prove the hypothesis that effective team performance management requires strong transformational leadership.

Design/methodology/approach- Transformational and charismatic leadership theories are briefly discussed from management science to explain how their principals can apply to and be analyzed in the project domain and other fields. Several popular and proven group leader behavior measurement constructs are discussed to show how they can be applied for assessing group leader behavior in any field. To flexible taxonomies are built for assisting in quantitatively and qualitatively explaining stakeholder perceptions of group leader behaviors and team performance. Four theoretically sampled case studies are analyzed. The taxonomies are analyzed quantitatively and the results are qualitatively evaluated.

Findings- The structured research illuminated that both effective and absent transformational leadership behaviors were practiced (idealized, influence, inspirational motivation, individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation), which can go unnoticed and un-reflected in the everyday pandemonium of busy project schedules, competing values, and organizational crisis, yet in retrospect, these results show that passive or absent leadership is noticed by the team members and sponsors; moreover it negatively impacts both project effectiveness and stakeholder satisfaction!

Research limitations/implications- Leaders, team members, stakeholders, and managers benefit from understanding transformational leadership, since it supports better human relations and organizational change. These cases show that effective team performance can result in minimal application of transformational leadership behaviors as long as they are not absent when required, and positive (not negative such as micro-management).
Originality/value- The research suggests that leader behavior is complex since it is situational, supported by multiple and concurrent leadership and trait theories, as well as partly driven by dominant personalities.

Since its inception in the 1980s, empirical studies have identified benefits of implementing the Magnet\&reg; Model involving improved patient care and nursing workforce outcomes. However, little is known about the leadership styles of nurse managers (NMs) working in a regional Australian context, which may hinder achieving Magnet\&reg; status. To close the knowledge gap, a self-administered survey was conducted to measure leadership styles of NMs at a large health organization comprising hospitals with a wide range of service profiles in regional Australia using a validated tool\&mdash;the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-6S). One-way of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify statistical significance between respondents\&rsquo; demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, gender) and their MLQ-6S scores. Respondents (n = 78) reported their leadership styles as more transformational, compared to transactional or passive/avoidant leadership styles. The findings indicated that NMs\&rsquo; higher education (p = 0.02) and older age (p = 0.03) were associated with TL styles, whereas passive/avoidant leadership was generally reported by female (p = 0.04) and younger (p = 0.06) respondents. This study has identified differences in reported leadership styles among NMs, providing a unique organizational insight into developing strategies to improve NMs\&rsquo; TL, which could help to facilitate the implementation of the Magnet\&reg; framework. Healthcare organizations in similar settings could benefit from replicating this study to identify a dominant leadership style and customize strategies to improve TL.},

The main objective of this paper is to explore the relationship between different leadership style practices and project success in the South African construction industry. The data used in this research were derived from both primary and secondary sources. The secondary data was collected via a detailed review of related literature. The primary data was collected through a structured questionnaire aimed at 150 project and construction managers in the South African construction industry. However, 110 questionnaires were received representing a 73\% response rate. Data from the questionnaire were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 software. Correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between leadership styles and project success. Likewise, the relationship between the different leadership styles and project successes in the South African construction industry was investigated using Pearson Product-moment Correlation Coefficient. Findings from the study revealed that there is a positive relationship between transactional leadership and project success. The results further revealed that there is no relationship between Laissez faire leadership style and construction project success. However, the study explores the relationship between leadership styles and project success in the South African construction industry. The study contributes to the body of knowledge of construction leadership by providing a robust background on construction leadership style practices of project and construction managers.},

Thus, the research reported in this paper explores the degrees to which leadership styles affect project outcome and specific leadership styles are appropriate in specific types of situations. The analysis is based on a questionnaire survey of views of 162 project managers employed by the largest public infrastructure client in Sweden. The results indicate that project performance (in terms of cost, time, and quality) is affected by leadership, suggesting that the project manager’s leadership style is a significant project success factor. Further, the results show that certain styles are appropriate in different situations, highlighting the importance of a contingency perspective.},

While team research has emphasized the importance of team-internal processes for smaller scale projects, we know little about collaborative processes (especially between teams) in such large-scale projects. This study utilizes a multi-informant longitudinal research design on a product development project (39 teams, 36 months) in the European automotive industry investigating collaboration between and within teams. The results of the study demonstrate that interteam coordination, project commitment, and teamwork quality as rated by the team members at Time 1 (Month 12; end of concept phase) are significantly correlated to project managers’ ratings of overall team performance at Time 3 (Month 36; end of project). The process variables measured at Time 2 (Month 24; end of design phase) display generally weaker correlations with team performance at Time 3. Multiple regression analyses further detail the effects of collaborative processes within and between teams on different measures of team performance (i.e., overall performance, quality, budget, schedule). The results show that collaborative processes during the project have predictive properties in regard to later team performance and can serve as early warning indicators. Furthermore, the results of this study provide support for our hypotheses predicting positive relationships between interteam coordination, project commitment, and teamwork quality. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.},

	abstract = {The emergence of temporary and democratic work forms characterizes work today and organisations to a great extent rely on individuals’ performance. Workers’ perceptions of working conditions are affected by two important factors: motivation and stress. Projects are motivating due to clear goals, but they are also often time pressured. Incidents like, for example, loss of resources, changing preferences or priorities, or project closure might provoke changes to the set goals, to which individuals have committed. This could obstruct effective goal fulfilment as well as create stress among the people involved. How do project managers and project team members perceive incidents that the typical project encounters? How do they cope with uncertainties the incidents bring about? The finding suggests that incidents cause changes over the project lifecycle, both of goals and of individuals’ perceptions of tasks, conditions, and the situation. Different coping strategies are used to reduce uncertainty and stress.},

A questionnaire was administered for data collection with a sample of 219 employees from both the public and the private sectors. The data were analyzed using linear regression. Findings The evidence was found on the relationship between culture and leadership style preference among Sabahans, namely Malay-Brunei, Bajau and Kadazan-Dusun. Research limitations/implications Understanding on what is preferred by employees and what is practiced by the leaders will lead to better and improved performance among the employees. Better understanding on the influence of culture will help a leader to be more effective and successful in their role. Therefore, it provide implication that leader should understand the culture in order for them to be accepted by the followers.

Based on a literature review, 16 tenure- and demographic-based groupings of employees (four departments, five work positions, five age groups and gender) were identified. Hypotheses were developed regarding whether employee group-based belonging overrides nationality-based belonging. These were tested across 15 countries and could be rejected for almost all groups due to significant differences in leadership preferences. Although the results concerning three employee groupings: researchers, supervisors and ‘over 55-years-old’ were inconclusive, it was not possible to identify one specific employee grouping that overrode nationality-based belonging. These results contribute to earlier research by refuting the often argued notion that departments, hierarchical work positions, professions, age groups and gender are categories of employees that should be managed as distinct groups with similar leadership preferences across country borders.},

A survey of 1137 employees across three organizations provided results that partially confirmed the predictions. Specifically, employees with higher levels of education and greater levels of job tenure expressed less preference for leader structuring, while females (relative to males) expressed greater preference for leader considerateness. These results suggest that an understanding of employee expectations for leader behaviors may be of value in optimizing the level and nature of leader involvement with subordinates.},

This paper proposes what project management practitioners consider to be skills and behaviours of an effective people project manager. A combination of literature review, face to face interviews and focus group meetings was applied to complete the research objective. Six specific skills and associated behaviours were identified as being most important. The results suggest that project managers would benefit from adopting these skills and behaviours to strengthen their managing people skills and behaviours to improve the successful delivery of projects. The findings also suggest that some skill sets and behaviours may be more appropriate for application in certain project environments such as IT or the construction industry.},

Affiliation correlated significantly with charisma, individualised consideration, and the over-all transformational leadership measure.

There was also a tendency for high achievers to favor such leaders. None of the other ratings of subordinates' personality traits correlated significantly with ratings of ideal leadership.

Our theoretical contribution aims to extend the employee involvement and leadership literatures by illustrating the relationships between different styles of leadership preferences from the follower-centric perspective. The findings highlight that Chinese new generation employees’ need for involvement negatively impacts on their preference for directive leadership and positively on their preference for high relationship-oriented leadership (i.e. participative and coaching leadership). Additionally, trust-in-supervisor is found to moderate the relationship between need for involvement and preference for delegating leadership.},

This study investigated the preferences and perceptions of Generation Y sport students towards the leadership behaviour of their coaches. The sport leadership scale of Chelladurai and Saleh (1980), which consists of five dimensions of leadership attributes, was used to conduct the study. A convenience sampling method was used to collect the data from the Generation Y sport students. Paired samples t-tests were conducted between the grouped dimensions of preferences and perceptions. The results indicated that Generation Y sport students would prefer, for example, to be provided with more training and advice, a more democratic approach by the coach, and that the coach should provide more social support and positive feedback. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine if perceptions and preferences of sport students regarding the leadership behaviour of coaches differed across the different sport codes. Limited differences were found. Overall, an instrument like this can be used by coaches to improve their coaching behaviour, if found necessary.

	abstract = {Executive Summary The roles of age, educational level, work experience, gender and needs for connection in predicting workers' ideal preferences for relational and job-centered leadership behaviors within the workplace were investigated. Most importantly, the role of workers' needs for connections as a mediating variable between gender and their ideal preferences for worker-centered and job centered leadership behaviors was examined. Measures of ideal leadership behavior preferences and needs for connection along with demographic information were completed by 1009 participants from three mid-western organizations. Controlling for organizational variables, regression analyses revealed that age and educational level were negatively correlated with workers' ideal preferences for worker-centered leadership behaviors; age, educational level and work experience were positively correlated with ideal preferences for job-centered leadership behaviors. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that after the effect of age and educational level had been controlled for, employees' gender accounted for a significant portion of the variance in explaining workers' ideal preferences for worker-centered leadership behaviors and mediated the relationship between gender and ideal preferences for worker-centered relational leadership behaviors. Post hoc analyses revealed no significant gender differences in ideal preferences for job-centered leadership behaviors. The findings are discussed in light of self-in-relation theory and with regard to how leaders may tailor their leadership styles to more effectively meet workers' needs and preferences.},

	abstract = {Purpose – To explain and illustrate the innovative full range leadership (FRL) model from Bass and Avolio and to demonstrate how this model can be utilized within organizations to develop transformational leadership. Design/methodology/approach – This paper describes in detail the FRL model and shows how the transformational leadership styles identified within the model are highly correlated with leader performance. Drawing on extensive personal consulting experience, the paper then outlines how the model, and the associated multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ), can be used successfully in training/development interventions in organizations. Findings – The FRL model is probably the most research and validated leadership model in use world‐wide today. The transformational styles described by the model are highly correlated with leadership success. Transformational leadership can be successfully taught by a development process which utilizes a combination of 360 degree feedback using the MLQ, structured workshops, and one‐to‐one coaching sessions. Practical implications – This paper offers a very practical leadership path approach to developing transformational leadership competence, drawing on extensive experience of delivering such programmes with large client organizations world‐wide. Originality/value – The originality of the FRL model lies in the concept of a “range” of leadership behaviors which all leaders demonstrate. Rather than insisting that one must lead “like this”, the FRL model makes the point that what is required is a change in the balance of leadership behaviours, away from the more transactional and more towards the transformational. The value of the paper lies in the description of a tried and tested methodology for applying the FRL model in an organizational setting.},

As well as explaining how to conduct good surveys, de Vaus shows how to become a critical consumer of research. He argues that the logic of surveys and statistics is simply an extension of the logic we use in everyday life; analysis, however, requires creativity and imagination rather than the application of sterile mechanical procedures. The prime goal of research should be to gain accurate understanding and, as a researcher, use methods and techniques which enhance understanding. De Vaus advocates researchers use the method, rather than letting the method use you.  Surveys in Social Research is essential reading for students and researchers working with surveys. It assumes no background in statistical analysis, and gives you the tools you need to come to grips with this often challenging field of work.},

	abstract = {This study examines the leadership competency profiles of successful project managers in different types of projects. Four hundred responses to the Leadership Development Questionnaire (LDQ) were used to profile the intellectual, managerial and emotional competences (IQ, MQ and EQ, respectively) of project managers of successful projects. Differences by project type were accounted for through categorization of projects by their application type (engineering \& construction, information \& telecommunication technology, organizational change), complexity, importance and contract type. Results indicate high expressions of one IQ sub-dimension (i.e. critical thinking) and three EQ sub-dimensions (i.e. influence, motivation and conscientiousness) in successful managers in all types of projects. Other sub-dimensions varied by project type. Comparison was made to existing profiles for goal oriented, involving and engaging leadership styles. Implications derived are the need for practitioners to be trained in the soft factors of leadership, particular for their types of projects. Theoretical implications include the need for more transactional styles in relatively simple projects and more transformational leadership styles in complex projects.},

	abstract = {Efficient project execution is a key business objective in many domains and particularly so for capital projects in the process industries, but existing project management research gives little direction about how project team factors influence three important capital project outcomes: cost, schedule, and operability. After an extensive cross-disciplinary review of the general team and project management literatures, we constructed and tested a theoretically based, five-dimensional model of organizational context, project team design, project team leadership, project team processes, and project outcome factors. We examined the model by means of an empirical study of 56 newly completed capital projects executed by 15 Fortune 500 companies in the process industries. The results indicate the value of disaggregating project outcomes for research purposes. Different bundles of project team factors were found to drive project cost, schedule, and operability. Project team efficacy, cross-functional project teams, autonomous project team structure, and virtual office usage were the strongest predictors of project cost effectiveness. Continuity of project leadership, cross-functional project teams, and project manager incentives were the strongest predictors of project construction schedule. In contrast, clear project goals and an office design to facilitate effective communication were the main predictors of plant operability. Implications of these findings for researchers and project practitioners are discussed. One major practical implication of our findings is that project managers need to clearly focus and prioritize their goals for each project so they can adopt the appropriate bundles of project team practices that will facilitate their goal achievement.},

Case study methodology employing semi‐structured interviews, written surveys, organisational document review and on‐site observations was used.

While both cultural workgroups preferred transformational leadership behaviours, they differed in the mix and intensity of transactional and transformational leadership behaviours they would prefer their supervisors to display.

A factor analysis was then run on the total sample of 711 managers.

Transactional leaders achieve performance as merely required by the use of contingent rewards or negative feedback. Previous research has shown that subordinates' perceptions of transformational leadership add to the prediction of subordinates' satisfaction and effectiveness ratings beyond that of perceptions of transactional leadership. The present study replicates the previous augmentation effects using subordinates' effectiveness ratings but was unable to confirm the augmentation hypothesis with independently attained superiors' evaluations as the criteria because of smaller sample size, although trends in the correlations were in the hypothesized direction. Transformational leadership obtained from their subordinates' ratings significantly differentiated top performing managers (identified as such through other sources) from ordinary managers as hypothesized. Results are discussed as they relate to a domestic work force that is becoming better educated and is more concerned about interesting work and self-development.

In Studies 3–5, Ss high in PNS were especially likely to organize social and nonsocial information in less complex ways, stereotype others, and complete their research requirements on time. These data suggest that people differ in their chronic desire for simple structure and that this difference can have important social–cognitive and behavioral implications.

Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a survey of three companies, one client organization, one consultancy firm and one contracting company. The useable survey comprised 251 individual responses from 600 distributed, giving a response rate of 41.83 percent. Findings – The findings show that consultative and consensus leadership styles are prevalent in the construction sector in the UAE. Further, it was found that an employee's job satisfaction is strongly affected by leadership, with more than 50 percent of survey respondents stating that leadership strongly influences their job satisfaction. Leadership style was found to moderately to strongly affect organizational commitment of employees in the industry in the UAE. Practical implications – The survey provides a useful instrument by which organizations across other sectors and within different cultural contexts can evaluate the significance of leadership style, job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Originality/value – The work is unique in that it is an examination of the impact of organizational leadership style within a contemporary regional context. A number of studies have been carried out in the Arab world that suggest that leadership in Arab culture nurtures consultative and participative tendencies. These are all outdated by more than a decade and no recent study in the Arabian Gulf region exists and none which explore leadership styles' impact on employees.},

Transformational leadership has been shown to have positive effects on trust, commitment and team efficacy. However, it could be argued that these results are not due to the leadership but to the idea that the team has developed strong norms that constrain their behavior and “force” them to perform. The rival hypothesis that the iron cage results in trust, commitment and team efficacy is tested using hierarchical regression analysis. We find that transformational leadership in teams predicts trust, commitment and team efficacy over and beyond the perceptions of the iron cage. The iron cage adds to the prediction of commitment only. Results suggest that while encouraging strong values and norms within a team will lead to increased commitment, focusing on transformational leadership in teams is a more effective way to encourage the development of trust, commitment and team efficacy.},

	abstract = {Rating scales and rubrics are commonly used measurement tools in educational contexts. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of controversy surrounding how data derived from these tools can and should be analyzed. One issue that is repeatedly raised is whether these data are ordinal or continuous. A related question is whether parametric data analysis techniques are appropriate and/or acceptable for these rating scale data. Some of this controversy may stem from a misunderstanding of fundamental issues related to these particular tools or a poor use of terminology. This article provides a review of basic issues surrounding measurement of various phenomena relevant to educational settings, as well as previous empirical studies examining the effects of using parametric analysis approaches on rating scale data. Based on previous empirical evidence reviewed in this article, parametric analytical approaches are acceptable provided certain criteria are met. Implications for research and teaching are also briefly discussed. After reading this article, the reader should be able to identify the characteristics of a true Likert scale and explain the situations when parametric analytical techniques are potentially appropriate for rating scale data or when nonparametric techniques are preferred.},

	abstract = {Background: Outstanding leadership is one of the important and vital concepts in management and
educational leadership debates especially in educational organizations such as universities. Thus,
effective educational leadership and adopting an appropriate tool to assess leadership in education
are crucial in these institutions. The present study was conducted to develop an instrument for measuring
the leadership style in faculty members.
, 
Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, content and face validity of Multifactor Leadership
Questionnaire (MLQ) was examined using the opinions of 10 experienced faculty members as a
panel of experts. For construct validity, 210 questionnaires were administered to faculty members of
Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Confirmatory factor analysis was run using principal component
analysis and Varimax rotation method. The reliability of the scale was measured through internal
consistency using Cronbach’s alpha formula. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine
the construct validity of the questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS v.16 and LISREL
software.
, 
Results: Factor analysis and expert opinion resulted in a questionnaire with 18 items across six subscales
including idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized
consideration, contingent reward, and management by exception. The reliability coefficient of the
questionnaire was acceptable (0.90). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the scale had appropriate
goodness of fit.
, 
Conclusion: The 18-item Educational Leadership Questionnaire was found to have acceptable validity
and reliability for measuring leadership style in the faculty. It is recommended that the questionnaire
be administered to a larger sample.},

First, alpha always has a value, which cannot be equal to the test score's reliability given the inter-item covariance matrix and the usual assumptions about measurement error. Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test's internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals' test performance.

Although these differences between male and female readers were small, the implications of these findings are encouraging for female leadership because other research has established that all of the aspects of leadership style on which women exceeded men relate positively to leaders' effectiveness whereas all of the aspects on which men exceeded women have negative or null relations to effectiveness.

Five categories of differences between mother and father were located. Attitudinal differences positively correlated with age in all four countries. Parental roles contained five response categories. All categories show the traditional sex bias. Mother is seen by all children as predominantly concerned with domestic duties, care of children, and low status occupations, while father is seen overwhelmingly in a leisure role, as occupier of high status occupations, and playing authority-leadership roles in the family.

Using a lexical decision making task, in Study 1 we demonstrated that agentic leadership traits were less accessible than communal leadership traits when the leader was female. Additionally, Study 1 also demonstrated that agentic traits were less accessible when the leader was female versus male. In Studies 2a and 2b, we replicated the differences we found for agentic leadership behaviors using perceiver’s self-ratings as the dependent variable. Results are discussed both in terms of their implications for future research on gender bias in leadership and their practical implications for eliminating gender bias against females who aspire to leadership positions.},

	abstract = {A social identity theory of leadership is described that views leadership as a group process generated by social categorization and prototype-based depersonalization processes associated with social identity. Group identification, as self-categorization, constructs an intragroup prototypicality gradient that invests the most prototypical member with the appearance of having influence; the appearance arises because members cognitively and behaviorally conform to the prototype. The appearance of influence becomes a reality through depersonalized social attraction processes that make followers agree and comply with the leader's ideas and suggestions. Consensual social attraction also imbues the leader with apparent status and creates a status-based structural differentiation within the group into leader(s) and followers, which has characteristics of unequal status intergroup relations. In addition, a fundamental attribution process constructs a charismatic leadership personality for the leader, which further empowers the leader and sharpens the leader-follower status differential. Empirical support for the theory is reviewed and a range of implications discussed, including intergroup dimensions, uncertainty reduction and extremism, power, and pitfalls of prototype-based leadership.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing recognition that freelancers or temporary contract workers are increasingly being used by organisations to enable them to become more dynamic and innovative, there is a lack of research exploring the extent and manner in which freelancers create value-added and affect net job change for employees. Most analyses view freelancers as substitutes for employees who compete for the same work and so add little or no value-added over that already provided by employees. More recent perspectives portray freelancers as non-competing complementary providers of differentiated labour who help create jobs for employees by enabling businesses to become more agile and entrepreneurial. We explore this empirical agenda and find that freelancers are associated with sales growth in businesses and net job creation for core employees. In the process, we also discover that in order to establish these effects, firms must achieve a critical mass of freelancers in their workforce of a scale around 11\% before a positive association emerges. This finding has central relevance for managers seeking to use freelance workforce intensity to enhance business performance. Moreover, while it has some intuitive appeal, this discovery requires further research to fully understand its cause and the process generating this outcome.},

It highlights the transformation dilemma, which occurs when traditional industrial institutions are confronted by project organizations. It also discusses how one may prepare to meet these challenges. Design/methodology/approach The long-run incremental changes in organizational structures of the economy are described in an economic historical context, focusing on the organizational form of work and the employment regimes. Challenges, at the societal, organizational and individual levels, related to the “projectification” process are illustrated in considering the case of Sweden. Findings Project dense industries, like media, entertainment and consultancy, are growing faster than the rest of the economy. The share of project work in permanent organizations is increasing. More than a third of all working hours in industrialized countries, like Germany, was labeled as project work in 2013. This transformation challenges basic conditions for how work is designed and regulated, like the stipulated and uniform work time or the permanent and stable work place. Central institutions of today, like the labor law and the educational system, are challenged. Social implications “Projectification” challenges traditional conditions of work and work life institutions and organizations, like the social partners, the educational and law systems. Originality/value The paper brings together and problematizes several aspects of “projectification” of work life. It highlights what kind of challenges work and work-related institutions meet and discusses how to handle some of them, like education.},

	abstract = {Individuals with different personalities approach an engineering project in different ways. These differences can cause tension and problems on projects by contributing to misunderstandings. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, based on Jung's classic psychological theories, can provide valuable insight into individual preferences for taking in information, organizing and evaluating that information, reaching conclusions, and dealing with the outer world. These characteristics, all relevant to conducting project work, are described by the following four preference scales: extraversion-introversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling, and judging-perceiving. Each of these preference scales is described. Example situations whereby these differences impact project performance are presented, as well as information on how to deal with these impacts. Understanding and accepting individual differences in these preferences can improve project performance. Data on the predominant preferences of project personnel in consulting engineering firms are presented and the ramifications are discussed.},

Part II presents different core concepts useful for analysing and understanding organizations - as entities within an environment, as social structures, technologies, cultures and physical structures, and as the products of power and political processes. Part III explores applications of organization theory to the practical matters of organizational design and change, and introduces the latest ideas, including organizational identity theory, process and practice theories, and aesthetics.

On the basis of meta-analytic findings, this article presents the validity of 19 selection procedures for predicting job performance and training performance and the validity of paired combinations of general mental ability (GMA) and the 18 other selection procedures. Overall, the 3 combinations with the highest multivariate validity and utility for job performance were GMA plus a work sample test (mean validity of .63), GMA plus an integrity test (mean validity of .65), and GMA plus a structured interview (mean validity of .63). A further advantage of the latter 2 combinations is that they can be used for both entry level selection and selection of experienced employees. The practical utility implications of these summary findings are substantial. The implications of these research findings for the development of theories of job performance are discussed.

Call center employees who volunteered to WFH were randomly assigned either to work from home or in the office for nine months. Home working led to a 13\% performance increase, of which 9\% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick days) and 4\% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter and more convenient working environment). Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction, and their attrition rate halved, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to reselect between the home and office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22\%. This highlights the benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern management practices like WFH.},

Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2. This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.},

Design/methodology/approach The authors explore the practical application of speculative bubble models to cryptocurrencies. They then show how the approach can be extended to provide estimated brand values using data from Google Trends. Findings The authors confirm previous findings of speculative bubbles in cryptocurrency markets. Relatedly, Google searches for cryptocurrencies seem to be primarily driven by recent price rises. Overall results are sufficient to question the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin with the suggestion that Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Ripple may all enjoy technical advantages relative to Bitcoin. Our results also demonstrate that Blockchain has a distinct value and identity beyond cryptocurrencies – providing foundational support for the second generation of academic work on Blockchain. However, a relatively low estimated long-term growth rate suggests that the benefits of Blockchain may take a long time to be fully realised. Originality/value The authors contribute to an emerging academic literature on Blockchain and to a more established literature exploring the use of Google data within business analytics.

Blockchain technology has the promise to change all existing business models and make financial services cheaper contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a better economic wealth distribution. Numerous studies optimistically praise such potential societal benefits by listing all processes that could be optimized through this technology. However, the picture is not necessary all bright. Blockchain can indeed disrupt and significantly improve our societies but there still exist some societal costs in the way this technology is implemented. This paper provides a perspective overviewing of the current trends related to the development of the most widely used implementation of blockchain technology based on the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. These trends will be discussed in three steps: the ‘Good Blockchain’ overviews how this technology can improve our societies; the ‘Bad blockchain’ offers a more nuanced perspective by discussing the potential polluting activities generated by some mining activities. Finally, the ‘Ugly blockchain’ investigates how this technology might generate a risk of concentration in the mining industry affecting therefore the nature and even the existence of the blockchain technology.},

	abstract = {Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.11A summary of the research projects reviewed in this study can be found in the Appendix A. Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze the effect that halving has on the fair market value of bitcoins. The main hypothesis of the study is that the decline in the cost of miners’ remuneration for mining is a significant factor that affects the price of cryptocurrencies. The article examines the factors that regulate the issuing process. The significance of a limited supply of bitcoin is detailed in the article, as well as the mechanism for the implementation of the issue of new bitcoins. The study compares the historical inflation data of the US dollar and the projected data on the inflation of bitcoin. The article analyzes the main technical element of cryptocurrency – halving – when the miner’s reward is halved. This analysis includes the mathematical methods of statistical data processing. Research results show that reducing remuneration by half every four years leads to an increased market value of the cryptocurrency. This relationship is clearly illustrated by the Kendall rank correlation method.The results of the study can have a significant impact on the fundamental assessment of bitcoin and can also enable investors to assess any of the existing and operating cryptocurrencies according to this method.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin's growth rate is about to half. Once every 210,000 blocks - that is approximately every 4 years - the rate at which new Bitcoin units are issued is cut in half. From block 0 to block 209,999, each block brought 50 new Bitcoin units into circulation. Between blocks 210,000 and 419,999, the reward was 25 Bitcoin units. Currently, the amount is 12.5 Bitcoin units. In less than a month, most likely on May 12th, the block reward will decrease once again to 6.25. In this article we take a closer look at the Bitcoin halving and tackle some common misconceptions surrounding this event.},

	abstract = {Proof of Work (PoW) powered blockchains currently account for more than 90\% of the total market capitalization of existing digital cryptocurrencies. Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin's PoW applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.},

We demonstrate how machine learning methods can contribute to non-for-profit pressing societal issues, like global warming, where data complexity and availability can be overcome.},
